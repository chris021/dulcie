Due to Covid restrictions, we held a private cremation. We would now like to invite Dulcie's colleagues, friends and extended family to a Memorial Service to commemorate her life. This service will be held at the Karikari Community Centre, 16 Matai Bay Road, Tokerau Beach at 12pm on the 26th of March 2022 and will be live- streamed for those unable to attend in person. If you require assistance with travel or accommodation; or want live- streaming details, please e-mail or telephone Vicki Ammundsen (<a color=\"blue\" href=\"mailto:vicki@vatl.nz\" text-decoration=\"underline\" class=\"Box-sc-5gsflb-0 Link-we4j6d-0 jjheVM\">vicki@vatl.nz</a>), 021 623 021 or Chris Hoffmann (<a color=\"blue\" href=\"mailto:chris@1c.co.nz\" text-decoration=\"underline\" class=\"Box-sc-5gsflb-0 Link-we4j6d-0 jjheVM\">chris@1c.co.nz</a>), 09 551 0431. The Memorial Service will be followed by refreshments. We are so grateful for the numerous floral arrangements and other kind gifts we received when Mum died but ask that in lieu of flowers, please feel free instead to donate to an animal charity of your choice.
